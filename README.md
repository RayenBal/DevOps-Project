## 🛠 Technologies Used

This project leverages a range of powerful tools to automate deployment, enhance security, and monitor system performance:

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:  
  - **Jenkins** – Orchestrates the continuous integration and delivery pipeline.

- **Code Quality & Security**:  
  - **SonarQube** – Analyzes code for quality, vulnerabilities, and potential bugs.  
  - **OWASP Dependency-Check** – Scans project dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.  
  - **Lynis** – Performs security audits and hardening checks on servers.  

- **Containerization**:  
  - **Docker** – Packages the application into containers for portability and scalability.  
  - **Docker Compose** – Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications.

- **Dependency Management**:  
  - **Nexus** – Manages and stores project dependencies and build artifacts.

- **Monitoring & Visualization**:  
  - **Prometheus** – Collects and stores metrics from the containers and services.  
  - **Grafana** – Visualizes the collected metrics for insightful monitoring and alerting.

- **Security Monitoring**:  
  - **Falco** – Monitors runtime behavior and detects abnormal or suspicious activity.  
  - **Pumba** – Simulates network failures and container crashes for resilience testing.

- **Programming Language**:  
  - **Java** (Spring Boot) – The backend application is built using the Spring Boot framework.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** – Required to build and run the Spring Boot application.
- **Docker** – For containerizing the application and running the environment.
- **Jenkins** – To manage the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Prometheus** – For collecting and monitoring application metrics.
- **Grafana** – For visualizing metrics and monitoring system performance.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RayenBal/DevOps-Project.git
    cd DevOps-Project
    ```

2. **Run Docker Compose** to set up the environment:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. **Access Jenkins**:
    - Open Jenkins in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.
    - Set up the pipeline using the provided `Jenkinsfile-advanced` to run the CI/CD pipeline.

## 🔄 Advanced DevOps Pipeline

The pipeline automates the full software lifecycle, including code quality checks, security scans, and monitoring:

1. **Git Checkout**: Clones the repository and checks out the latest branch.
2. **Compile Project**: Executes `mvn clean compile` to compile the codebase.
3. **Unit Tests**: Runs unit tests and collects results.
4. **JaCoCo Coverage Report**: Generates a code coverage report.
5. **SonarQube Analysis**: Performs static code analysis for quality and security vulnerabilities.
6. **Dependency Vulnerability Scan**: Uses OWASP Dependency-Check to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
7. **Build & Push Docker Image**: Builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.
8. **Nexus Deployment**: Deploys build artifacts to Nexus repository.
9. **Deployment with Docker Compose**: Deploys services using Docker Compose.
10. **Container Monitoring**: Prometheus collects metrics, and Grafana visualizes them.
11. **Security Smoke Tests**: Runs security tests to validate the system.
12. **Server Hardening Validation**: Runs Lynis security checks on the server.
13. **Notifications**: 
    - **Twilio SMS**: Sends SMS alerts for build status.
    - **Email**: Sends an email with detailed build reports.

---

## 📊 Reports & Notifications
- **JaCoCo Coverage Report**: Provides detailed insights on code coverage.
- **OWASP Dependency-Check Report**: Lists vulnerabilities found in project dependencies.
- **Lynis Report**: Offers a security validation report for the server.
- **Twilio SMS Alert**: Sends notifications about build completion via SMS.
- **Email Notification**: Sends detailed build results along with links to coverage and security reports.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Security
- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics from Docker containers and application endpoints.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes Prometheus metrics in real-time for monitoring system health.
- **Falco**: Detects and alerts on abnormal runtime behaviors.
- **Lynis**: Conducts security audits and identifies potential vulnerabilities on the host system.
- **Pumba**: Simulates network issues and container failures for testing system resilience.
